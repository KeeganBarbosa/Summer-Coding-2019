# Summer-Coding-2019
Keegan, Sam and Manvir work on coding problems summer 2019. 
We implemented a few machine learning algorithms in the 'Pulsar Star Prediction' python notebook. Specifically, we used Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes classifier, Decision Tree classifer, Random Forest and Xgboost to detect pulsar stars. We used the f1 scores to compare the different algorithms and we used random under-sampling and random over-sampling to address the imbalance in the dataset.
